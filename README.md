# Statistical_Analysis
Scripts coded in Matlab to carry out statistical analysis of EEG time series data and time-frequency data (to be added shortly).
When carrying out the cluster-based permutation test using the script "ClusterAnalysis_TimeLock_ft.m", it is possible to choose to calculate the surface Laplacian. But, for the moment, this is not advised as the scripts called need to be updtaed. 

The Crex_ExtractMontage() and the "CREx_CalcGH"  functions are required if you wish to calculate the surface Laplacian when carrying out the cluseter-based spatial permutation test. But this is not advisable for the moment.
